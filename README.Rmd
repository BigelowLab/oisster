### Installation

```
remotes::install_gitgub("BigelowLab/charlier")
remotes::install_gitgub("BigelowLab/oisster")
```

### Data path

This package can be used to download and manage many GEOTIFF files in a location **of your choosing.** You need to create and set the path once before using the package (and if you ever change the data storage location.)  Let's suppose that your data path is `/mnt/ecocast/coredata/oisst`.  Use the `set_root_path()` function first.

```
oisster::set_root_path(`/mnt/s1/projects/ecocast/coredata/oisst`)
```

The function will save this information in a hidden file securely in your home folder. Using the above allows you to return to working with the data in later R sessions without the fuss of setting things up each time.  

### Get some data for the first time.

The package provides a single function for getting data, `fetch_oisst()`. What gets downloaded depends upon the product that you select.  See `?fetch_oisst` for details.  You can save data for a particular region or the entire world, but let's just do the Gulf of St Lawrence in Eastern Canada for now. Note that the longitude values for OISST range from 0 to 360, so we define our bounding box this way, too, rather than in the range of -180 to 180.

First we load what we need for software, and then define the region nickname, 'gosl', and bounding box.  Then we make the data path.

```{r start} 
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(oisster)
  library(stars)
  library(dplyr)
})
region = 'gosl'
bb = c(xmin = 293, xmax = 303.5, ymin = 44.4, ymax = 50.5)
path = oisst_path(region)
ok = dir.create(path, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
```

#### Daily mean data
Now download a short sequence of daily mean values. Note that OISST actually starts in September of 1981 and runs through "yesterday", so there's more data you can download. This can take a while to run depending upon yoyr connection, server activity and the weather (kidding).

We are passing in a a pair of dates for the start and stop, but the reality is that the function downloads all data between the two dates.

```{r fetch_days}
db_day = oisster::fetch_oisst(dates = as.Date(c("1982-01-01", "1983-12-31")),
                          param = "sst.day.mean",
                          path = path,
                          bb = bb) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```
The database return is a simple table we can use to reconstruct filenames.  Note that there is no directory path saved in the database; this omission is intentional.  Also not that the `ltm` column is all NA.  We'll use that column for recording the period over which the long term mean (ltm) is computed.

#### Monthly mean data
Let's also collect some monthly mean data for the same time period.

```{r fetch_month}
db_month = oisster::fetch_oisst(dates = as.Date(c("1982-01-01", "1983-12-31")),
                          param = "sst.mon.mean",
                          path = path,
                          bb = bb) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

#### Long term mean data
Or even long-term means for which we don't specify the date.

```{r fetch_months}
db_ltm = oisster::fetch_oisst(param = "sst.mon.ltm.1991-2020",
                              path = path,
                              bb = bb) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

Note that the `ltm` column is now populated.

#### Build a database

We have the databases for each downloaded file; we could bind these and save for later use.  But we also have built in tools for creating, writing and reading the database.  `build_database` will automatically scan the path provided for all the raster files, and decompose the filenames into a database

```{r build_database}
DB = oisster::build_database(path, save_db = TRUE) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

The database may show that you have variants on the period (`per`) or treatment (`trt`).

```{r count}
dplyr::count(DB, per, trt, ltm)
```

### Opening a series

If you filter the database to a subset of interest, say the beginning of first of each month in 1992, then you can load them into a `stars` array.

```{r filter}
db <- dplyr::filter(DB,
                    param == 'sst',
                    per == 'day',
                    trt == 'mean',
                    date %in% seq(as.Date("1982-01-01"), length = 12, by = "month"))
db
```


Now read them in and plot

```{r read}
S <- read_oisst(db, path)
plot(S)
```


### Generating annual summaries

You can use [this script](inst/scripts/annual_summaries.R) to generate annual summaries from the dailies.  Here we load 12 years of annual means (computed from daily means) starting in 1992.

```{r annuals}
db <- dplyr::filter(DB,
                    param == 'sst',
                    per == 'ann',
                    trt == 'mean',
                    date %in% seq(as.Date("1992-01-01"), length = 12, by = "year"))
if (nrow(db) > 0){
  S <- read_oisst(db, path)
  plot(S)
} else {
  cat("no annual summaries found")
}
```
